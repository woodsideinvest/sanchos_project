Acquisition of a 24 per                          cent interest in PDL-1 in 1998 gave Santos access to a significant part of the giant Hides gas                          field and resulted in Santos becoming a foundation partner in the PNG LNG project. Following                          the company’s merger with Oil Search in December 2021, Santos’ overall interest in this                          project increased.</p>                        <p>PNG LNG is an integrated development that includes gas production and processing facilities                          that extend from Hela, Southern Highlands, Western and Gulf provinces to Port Moresby. The                          facilities are connected by over 700 kilometres of onshore and offshore pipelines and include                          a gas conditioning plant in Hides and a two-train liquefaction and storage facility near Port                          Moresby.</p>                        <p>LNG production began in April 2014 and since then, PNG LNG has been reliably supplying LNG to                          four long-term major customers in Asia.</p>                        <p>Santos is positioned to grow its presence in PNG through PNG LNG backfill and expansion,                          including development of the P’nyang field, as well as standalone opportunities. The company                          is also a joint venture partner in the Papua LNG Project, which proposes to integrate its                          midstream development within PNG LNG.</p>                        <h3 id="Gladstone">Gladstone LNG (GLNG)</h3>                        <p><strong>Queensland, Australia</strong></p>                        <p>With a large resource base in Queensland and a growing Asian demand for liquefied natural gas                          (LNG), Santos created the GLNG project in 2007, a pioneering project to convert natural gas,                          including coal seam gas from the Bowen and Surat Basins, into LNG for export to Asia.</p>                        <p>GLNG is a joint venture between Santos and three of the world’s leading energy companies:                          PETRONAS from Malaysia, Total from France and KOGAS from South Korea.</p>                        <p>The project involved the development of gas fields in the Bowen and Surat Basins, the                          construction of a 420-kilometre underground gas transmission pipeline to Gladstone and a                          two-train liquefaction and storage facility on Curtis Island in Gladstone. GLNG sells                          approximately two cargoes of LNG per week and has been supplying two long-term Asian customers                          since the first cargo was shipped in October 2015.</p>                        <p>As upstream operator, Santos is focused on building gas supply through upstream development,                          seeking opportunities to extract value from our infrastructure and driving efficiencies.</p>                        <p>Find out more about GLNG operations </p>                        <h3 id="Bayu-Undan">Bayu-Undan and Barossa to DLNG</h3>                        <p><strong>Offshore Timor-Leste, and offshore and onshore Northern Territory, Australia</strong>                        </p>                        <p>Located at Wickham Point, Darwin LNG is a single train liquefaction and storage facility that                          started production in 2006. The Bayu-Undan field, which supplies gas to the plant via a                          26-inch subsea pipeline, is located approximately 500 kilometres northwest of Darwin in                          Timor-Leste offshore waters. The facility includes a central production and processing complex                          with a floating production, storage and offloading vessel for condensate and LPG products and                          an unmanned wellhead platform. Santos operates both the Darwin LNG plant and Bayu-Undan                          facility.</p>                        <p>When Bayu-Undan ceases production, the Barossa gas field will be the source of gas to                          backfill Darwin LNG, with first gas production expected in the first half of 2025. In March                          2021, Santos announced the Final Investment Decision on the Barossa Gas                          Project, which is located 300 kilometres north of Darwin.</p>                        <p>The Darwin LNG plant has the capacity to produce approximately 3.7 million tonnes of LNG per                          annum. Barossa is a world-class new LNG supply project and will give Santos and Darwin LNG a                          competitive advantage in a tightening global LNG market. At the time of Final Investment                          Decision, the project represented the biggest investment in Australia’s oil and gas sector                          since 2012.</p>                        <p>Development of the large, discovered Barossa resource will extend the operating life of DLNG                          for an additional 20 years, thereby continuing to help meet future global demand for natural                          gas and contributing significant income and employment opportunities for Australia.</p>                        <h3 id="ADWC">Australian Domestic West Coast</h3>                        <p>Santos is the second biggest producer of domestic gas in Western Australia and has been                          operating in the west since its first oﬀshore discovery in the Carnarvon Basin, in the early                          1980s.</p>                        <p>The company also has a strategic infrastructure position in WA, with interests in three of                          the state’s major domestic gas plants, at Varanus Island, Devil Creek and Macedon.</p>                        <p>Gas, condensate and oil from the oﬀshore John Brookes, Harriet and Spar-Halyard fields is                          piped to the Santos-operated Varanus Island processing facility.
